# API Documentation – Technical Editing Case Study

This repository presents a technical editing case study focused on improving API documentation quality. It demonstrates my ability to:

- Rewrite unclear or incomplete API documentation into accurate, structured reference material  
- Apply copyediting, substantive editing, and developmental editing to technical content  
- Ensure consistency across endpoints, parameters, and examples  
- Use global English standards for translatability and clarity  
- Identify and remove ambiguity in API descriptions and usage scenarios  
- Produce documentation that aligns with the expectations of AWS technical editing and certification content

This project includes both the original unedited API notes and the edited version, along with before/after comparisons and editorial rationale.
