# Editorial Rationales and Improvements

This document explains the editorial decisions made while transforming the original API notes into clear, structured documentation.

---

## 1. Structural Editing
The original content lacked a consistent structure.  
The rewritten version established:

- Endpoint title  
- HTTP method and path  
- Required fields  
- Optional fields  
- Request examples  
- Response examples  
- Error codes  
- Notes on consistency  

This mirrors industry-standard API documentation formats.

---

## 2. Removal of Ambiguity
The original notes included vague phrasing such as:

- "does something"
- "maybe returns"
- "not sure"
- "sometimes errors"

These were replaced with precise, testable language.

---

## 3. Global English Application
Ensured all sentences are:

- Direct  
- Neutral  
- Free from idioms  
- Globally understandable  

---

## 4. Technical Accuracy Improvements
Where original notes lacked clarity, assumptions were validated against standard API patterns:

- Required fields added based on typical use  
- Status codes aligned with common practices  
- JSON examples corrected  

---

## 5. Consistency Improvements
Field names, error structures, and response formats were standardized.

This ensures:

- Predictability  
- Reduced cognitive load  
- Easier integration testing  

---

## 6. Editorial Role Alignment

These improvements demonstrate key skills of a technical editor in a certification context:

- Identifying unclear or incomplete content  
- Ensuring fairness and clarity  
- Maintaining technical precision  
- Improving translatability through global English principles  
- Producing reference material suitable for exam questions or instructional use
